      "Megan Thee Stallion is giving us all some much-needed inspiration as the Grammy winner graduated from college over the past weekend. The Texas native took some dank pictures from her commencement ceremony, to which she wore a stunning, bedazzled ‘real hot girl sh*t’ cap. While Megan looked stunning, the cap certainly became a show-stealer, while giving a not-so-subtle nod to her 2019 hit song Hot Girl Summer.

The pics see the 26-year-old looking absolutely gorgeous as she holds her ‘real hot girl sh*t’ cap. Megan is seen pouting and looking proudly at the camera as he shows off her cap. We also love her red and white manicures that contain the school’s acronym on them.   The singer wrote in the caption, “2021 finna graduate collegeeee taking my graduation pics today I can’t wait for y’all to see.” Hence, fans can expect to see more pictures from the ceremony. We are dying to see what the star wore on her special day. Back in June 2020, the three-time Grammy winner had explained why she didn’t let her fame get in the way of her education. In a candid interview with People, the Girls In The Hood singer said, “‘I want to get my degree because I really want my mom to be proud. She saw me going to school before she passed.” Megan’s mom, Holly Thomas, died in March 2019 after fighting brain cancer. The singer, who has been through her fair share of pain and loss in life, also lost her grandmother around the same time. Both these women have inspired her to be the star she is today. The singer, who was a part-time student at Texas Southern University, graduated with a degree in Health Administration. During COVID-19, Megan completed her classes online, just like other students around the world. SEE: Who is TikTok’s Jinnkid?
